## Processing

### Processing.js

[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) is a port of the Processing Visualization Language, based on HTML Canvas.

* nice [L-System example (CodePen)](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/WdBzjw), creating a space-filling curve

### p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is JS library of the Processing language. 

TL;DR difference between P5 and Processing.js (taken from
[this article](https://www.sitepoint.com/processing-js-vs-p5-js-whats-difference/)):
*"P5 is a direct JS port of the Processing language. Processing.js
is a converter which interprets pure Processing code into JS on the fly. The
latter requires you to learn Processing, but not JS, and vice versa."*

It seems to be the better option of the two.

The book [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) has a
bunch of nice p5.js examples, that are
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/generative-design/Code-Package-p5.js),
and runnable live in the [p5.js Web Editor](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/).
