# Windows 10 Tweaks

## Ultimate Windows Tweaker 4 for Windows

As fishy as it sounds,
[Ultimate Windows Tweaker](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/ultimate-windows-tweaker-4-windows-10)
is actually pretty useful to get rid of some annoying UI elements.

Some useful setting (as organized in UWT):

### Customization

#### Windows 10

* disable "recent files" in quick access (explorer)
* to still be able to pin favorites (Downloads, home, code, docs, work)
  in quick access, do *not* disable "frequent folder" in UWT, but rather:
  * explorer → context menu on "quick access" → options
  * disable "show recently used files" / "show freq. used folders"
  * → only explicitly pinned directories will be listed

#### File Explorer

* Tweak Drive Letters: "Before Labels"
* "-Shortcut" Suffix for New Shortcuts → Remove
* File Explorer Startup: "This PC"

#### This PC

* Customize Inbuilt Folders: disable all the crap (Desktop, 3D Objects, Music, …)

### Security & Privacy

#### Security

##### Windows

* disable OneDrive

#### Privacy

* disable pretty much everything
* keep enabled where it makes sense:
  * Windows Update Sharing
  * password reveal button
  * app access to location
  * app access to camera
  * app access to microphone
  * app access to user account info

### Additional

* disable "Use Autoplay for All Media and Devices"

#### Network Tweaks

* enable NTLM 2 support
